# Smartphone-Pricing-Classifier
This project, developed as part of the CSE422 (Machine Learning) course, explores the use of supervised learning algorithms to predict mobile phone price categories (low, medium, high, very high) based on their technical specifications such as RAM, battery power, processor performance, and camera quality.

The notebook includes:

1.Data preprocessing & feature engineering

2.Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers (Decision Tree, KNN and SVM)

3.Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

4.Insights into which algorithm performs best for this classification task

Our experiments showed that the SVM classifier achieved the highest performance with 98% accuracy, outperforming the Decision Tree model (~81%) and KNN (91.8%).
